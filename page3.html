  <h3>
 As huge portions of the forests are cleared away, exposing what's left of the earth to whither and die
 and the homes of over 28,000 species to be destroyed, the indigenous tribes whose lives depend on these
 forests to sustain their way of life are also irreparably damaged. The loss of forests has an immediate
 and direct effect on their lifestyle that we wouldnâ€™t understand. The indegnious tribes have been evicted
 from their homes. (Pachamama Alliance)
